Stage 2 Development Guide: Audio Recording System
Browser Audio Recording Architecture
Implement a comprehensive audio recording system using the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder API for cross-browser compatibility. Design the recording architecture to support extended lesson durations while maintaining audio quality and system stability. Create a recording service class that manages audio stream acquisition, encoding configuration, and real-time monitoring of recording status.
Configure audio capture settings to optimize for classroom environments, including sample rate selection of 44.1kHz, bit depth configuration for quality preservation, and automatic gain control to handle varying speaker volumes. Implement noise suppression and echo cancellation features to enhance recording clarity in typical classroom acoustics.
Establish error handling mechanisms for microphone access denial, audio device disconnection, and browser compatibility issues. Create fallback procedures for situations where preferred audio settings are unavailable, ensuring consistent functionality across different hardware configurations.
Recording Interface Development
Design and implement a formal, minimal recording interface integrated into the teacher dashboard with Hebrew language support. Create intuitive recording controls including start, pause, resume, and stop functionality with clear visual indicators for recording status. Implement a real-time duration display and audio level monitoring to provide immediate feedback during recording sessions.
Build a pre-recording setup interface that allows teachers to test microphone functionality and adjust input levels before beginning lesson capture. Include audio source selection capabilities for environments with multiple microphone options. Design visual elements using subtle color schemes that maintain focus on the lesson rather than the technology interface.
Develop automatic recording naming conventions based on date, time, and optional lesson identifiers. Create prompt systems for teachers to add lesson metadata including subject, class level, and planned curriculum topics before recording initiation.
File Storage and Management System
Implement a robust file storage architecture capable of handling large audio files generated during extended recording sessions. Design a multi-tier storage system using local browser storage for temporary recording buffers and server-based storage for permanent file retention. Configure automatic file compression without quality degradation to optimize storage efficiency.
Create a progressive upload system that transfers audio data to the server in manageable chunks during or immediately after recording completion. Implement upload resumption capabilities to handle network interruptions without data loss. Design storage organization using hierarchical folder structures based on teacher accounts, academic terms, and subject classifications.
Establish automated backup procedures for recorded content with redundant storage locations to prevent data loss. Implement file integrity verification using checksums to ensure audio data remains uncorrupted during storage and transfer operations. Create storage quota management systems with automated cleanup of old recordings based on configurable retention policies.
Audio Processing and Quality Control
Develop audio processing pipelines that enhance recording quality while maintaining original content fidelity. Implement noise reduction algorithms specifically tuned for classroom environments, removing common background sounds while preserving speech clarity. Create automatic volume normalization to ensure consistent playback levels across different recordings.
Build quality assessment tools that analyze recorded audio for issues such as clipping, excessive noise, or insufficient volume levels. Generate quality reports immediately after recording completion, alerting teachers to potential issues that might affect content usability. Implement automatic recompression for recordings that exceed optimal file size thresholds without compromising audio quality.
Design format standardization procedures that convert recordings to consistent audio formats suitable for web playback and AI processing requirements. Create multiple quality versions of each recording to support different use cases including high-quality archival storage and optimized streaming for content generation processes.
Playback System Implementation
Create a comprehensive audio playback system integrated into both teacher and student interfaces with Hebrew language controls. Implement advanced playback features including speed adjustment, chapter navigation based on detected pause patterns, and bookmark functionality for important lesson segments. Design playback interfaces that maintain the formal, minimal aesthetic while providing necessary functionality.
Build streaming capabilities that allow playback to begin before complete file download, enabling immediate review of recorded content. Implement progressive loading with visual progress indicators to inform users of buffering status. Create offline playback capabilities for environments with limited internet connectivity.
Develop synchronized transcript display functionality that highlights text segments corresponding to current playback position. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common playback operations to enhance teacher workflow efficiency during lesson review and content preparation phases.
Recording Session Management
Design comprehensive session management systems that track recording activities across multiple lessons and academic periods. Create session databases that store recording metadata including duration, file sizes, quality metrics, and associated lesson information. Implement session recovery procedures for interrupted recordings that preserve captured content and allow continuation from interruption points.
Build recording schedule integration that automatically suggests recording initiation based on class timetables and curriculum planning. Create reminder systems that notify teachers of upcoming lessons requiring recording activation. Implement batch processing capabilities for handling multiple recordings simultaneously during busy academic periods.
Establish recording permission management systems that control access to sensitive content and maintain student privacy requirements. Create audit trails that document recording activities for administrative oversight and compliance purposes.
Performance Optimization and Resource Management
Implement efficient memory management systems that prevent browser crashes during extended recording sessions. Design garbage collection procedures that regularly clear temporary audio buffers while maintaining recording continuity. Create resource monitoring tools that track system performance and alert users to potential capacity issues before they affect recording quality.
Optimize audio encoding processes to minimize CPU usage while maintaining quality standards. Implement adaptive quality settings that automatically adjust recording parameters based on available system resources. Design bandwidth management systems that prioritize recording functionality over other network activities during active recording sessions.
Create caching mechanisms for frequently accessed recordings that reduce server load and improve playback responsiveness. Implement compression algorithms specifically optimized for speech content that achieve maximum size reduction while preserving intelligibility for AI processing requirements.
Testing and Validation Procedures
Develop comprehensive testing protocols that validate recording functionality across different browsers, operating systems, and hardware configurations. Create automated test suites that verify recording duration accuracy, audio quality preservation, and file integrity maintenance throughout the storage and retrieval process.
Implement stress testing procedures that simulate extended recording sessions under various system load conditions. Validate recording system performance with different microphone types, room acoustics, and background noise levels typically encountered in educational environments. Create regression testing frameworks that ensure new features do not compromise existing recording capabilities.
Establish quality assurance procedures that verify Hebrew language interface elements display correctly during recording operations. Test recording resumption capabilities after browser crashes, network interruptions, and system hibernation events to ensure data preservation under adverse conditions.
The successful completion of this stage will deliver a professional-grade audio recording system capable of capturing high-quality lesson content for extended durations while maintaining system stability and user experience standards appropriate for educational environments.
