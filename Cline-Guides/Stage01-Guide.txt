Stage 1 Development Guide: Core Infrastructure & User Management
Project Setup and Technology Stack
Begin by creating a new web application using modern web technologies optimized for Hebrew language support. Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and React frontend with right-to-left language support.
Create the following directory structure:

/server for backend API
/client for React frontend
/shared for common utilities
/database for schema and migrations

Install essential dependencies including bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for authentication, pg for PostgreSQL connection, react-i18next for internationalization, and styled-components for component styling.
Database Schema Implementation
Design and implement the core database tables with proper Hebrew text support using UTF-8 encoding. Create a users table with fields for user ID, email, password hash, role (teacher/student), first name, last name, phone number, and timestamps. Establish a schools table linking teachers and students to specific institutions. Include proper foreign key relationships and constraints.
Add database indexes for email lookups and role-based queries to ensure optimal performance. Implement database connection pooling and error handling to maintain system stability.
Authentication System Architecture
Develop a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system supporting both teacher and student roles. Create registration endpoints that validate Hebrew text input and enforce strong password requirements. Implement secure login functionality with rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
Build middleware functions for route protection and role verification. Ensure session management handles token refresh and secure logout procedures. Include email verification for new account activation and password reset functionality.
Hebrew Language Framework
Establish complete Hebrew localization using react-i18next with right-to-left text direction support. Create comprehensive translation files covering all interface elements, error messages, and system notifications. Implement proper Hebrew typography with appropriate fonts and spacing.
Configure the application to detect and maintain Hebrew language settings across user sessions. Ensure proper date formatting, number display, and text input handling for Hebrew content.
User Interface Development
Design and implement separate interface themes for teachers and students using a formal, minimal aesthetic. Create a clean navigation structure with subtle color schemes emphasizing functionality over decoration. Implement responsive design principles ensuring consistent appearance across different screen sizes.
Build reusable component libraries for forms, buttons, navigation elements, and data display widgets. Apply consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy throughout both interfaces.
Role-Based Access Control
Develop comprehensive permission systems distinguishing teacher and student capabilities. Create protected routing mechanisms that automatically redirect users based on their assigned roles. Implement dashboard layouts appropriate for each user type with distinct navigation menus and feature access.
Build authorization middleware that validates user permissions for every API endpoint. Ensure proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts with clear Hebrew error messages.
Security Implementation
Implement input validation and sanitization for all user data entry points. Apply CSRF protection and secure headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities. Configure password hashing with appropriate salt rounds and implement secure password policies.
Add logging mechanisms for authentication events and failed access attempts. Implement session timeout functionality and secure cookie handling practices.
Testing and Validation
Create comprehensive test suites covering user registration, login, logout, and role-based access functionality. Verify Hebrew text handling across all input fields and display elements. Test authentication flows for both teacher and student roles with various scenarios including invalid credentials and expired tokens.
Validate database operations including user creation, modification, and proper constraint enforcement. Ensure error handling provides meaningful Hebrew messages for all failure scenarios.
Deployment Configuration
Configure production environment settings including database connections, environment variables, and security configurations. Set up proper logging levels and error monitoring systems. Implement health check endpoints for system monitoring.
Establish backup procedures for user data and authentication credentials. Configure SSL certificates and secure communication protocols for production deployment.
The completion of this stage will result in a fully functional user management system with Hebrew language support, secure authentication, and role-based access control serving as the foundation for subsequent development phases.
