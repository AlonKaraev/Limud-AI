When receiving a task, I expect cline to follow these stages:

**Stage 01 - Planning**  
Plan the implementation. At the end of this stage, cline must ask follow-up questions to clarify requirements before proceeding.

**Stage 02 - Mock HTML**  
Create mock HTML for each relevant function or GUI part to test new code. Before moving to the next stage, cline should ask follow-up questions to ensure the mockups meet expectations.

**Stage 03 - Integration**  
Integrate the code. After integration, cline must ask follow-up questions to confirm successful integration and address any issues before continuing.

**Stage 04 - Documentation**  
Document the workflow and code. At the end of this stage, cline should ask follow-up questions to verify that the documentation is complete and clear.
