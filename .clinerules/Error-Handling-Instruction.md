Error Handling Excellence:
Frontend (React):

Implement React Error Boundaries to catch component crashes gracefully
Use try-catch blocks for async operations and API calls
Provide meaningful, user-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon
Include loading states and fallback UI components for failed requests
Validate user inputs with clear, real-time feedback
Handle network failures and offline scenarios

Backend (Node.js):

Implement comprehensive error middleware for Express applications
Use proper HTTP status codes (400s for client errors, 500s for server errors)
Log errors with sufficient context for debugging (timestamps, user IDs, request data)
Sanitize error responses to prevent information leakage in production
Handle async/await properly with try-catch blocks
Implement circuit breakers for external service calls

Database (PostgreSQL/SQLite):

Handle connection failures and timeouts gracefully
Implement proper transaction rollbacks on errors
Validate data constraints and provide meaningful error messages
Handle concurrent access issues and deadlocks
Log database errors with query context for troubleshooting

User Experience:

Design error states that match the overall UI aesthetic
Provide actionable error messages with suggested next steps
Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate
Show progress indicators and timeout warnings
Maintain UI consistency even during error states
Consider accessibility in error message design
