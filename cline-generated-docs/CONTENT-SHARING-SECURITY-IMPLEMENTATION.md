## Configuration Options

### Security Middleware Settings
```javascript
const securityConfig = {
    rateLimit: {
        windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
        maxRequests: 100,
        skipSuccessfulRequests: false
    },
    piiDetection: {
        enabled: true,
        redactionChar: '*',
        logDetections: true
    },
    contentValidation: {
        minLength: 10,
        maxLength: 50000,
        requireMetadata: true
    }
};
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
```javascript
const alertThresholds = {
    failedLogins: { count: 5, timeWindow: 300 },
    suspiciousAccess: { count: 10, timeWindow: 600 },
    rateLimit: { count: 100, timeWindow: 3600 },
    piiDetection: { count: 3, timeWindow: 1800 }
};
```

## Integration Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the security schema migration
sqlite3 your_database.db < database/security-enhancements-schema.sql
```

### 2. Middleware Integration
```javascript
// In your main app.js
const contentSecurity = require('./middleware/contentSecurity');

// Apply security middleware to content routes
app.use('/api/content', contentSecurity.validateRequest);
app.use('/api/share', contentSecurity.validateSharing);
```

### 3. Service Initialization
```javascript
// Initialize security services
const SecurityMonitoringService = require('./services/SecurityMonitoringService');
const ContentCleanupService = require('./services/ContentCleanupService');

const securityMonitor = new SecurityMonitoringService();
const cleanupService = new ContentCleanupService();

// Start monitoring (checks every 5 minutes)
securityMonitor.startMonitoring(5);

// Schedule cleanup (runs hourly)
cleanupService.scheduleCleanup();
```

### 4. Route Integration
```javascript
// Add consent management routes
const studentConsentRoutes = require('./routes/student-consent');
app.use('/api/consent', studentConsentRoutes);
```
